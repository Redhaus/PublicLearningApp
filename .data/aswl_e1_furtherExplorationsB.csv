aswl1_e1,1974-,Marco,Roth,Roland Barthes: Myths We Don’t Outgrow,"Perhaps the best way to understand what drove Roland Barthes, then a thirty-nine-year-old professor of literature, to begin writing the series of short essays later published as “Mythologies” is to take a brief glance at the myth of the supposedly decadent influence of French theory on American intellectual life. “He’d met Roland Barthes, at a dinner party, and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith,” goes a line about a Brown semiotics professor in Jeffrey Eugenides’s recent novel, “The Marriage Plot.” It’s a sentence that both describes and reënacts the mysterious process by which an essayist and literary critic who would have “interrogated” that dish of duck fat, beans, and sausage, demanding to know what it thought it was doing at his dinner party, somehow came to be seen as just another aspect of the stereotypical Frenchness he’d set out to unmask as a repressive fraud….

New Age devotees, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, feminists, writers, philosophers, theologians and critics of patriarchal societies have all been arguing that long-ignored traditions of goddess worship provide rich resources for social and cultural renewal. The important progress that has been made in developing a responsible reconsideration of the history and significance of goddesses underscores the serious shortcomings of Anne Baring and Jules Cashford's disappointing book, ""The Myth of the Goddess: Evolution of an Image….

aswl1_e1,na,Julie,Maybee,Hegel’s Dialectics,"“Dialectics” is a term used to describe a method of philosophical argument that involves some sort of contradictory process between opposing sides. In what is perhaps the most classic version of “dialectics”, the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato (see entry on Plato), for instance, presented his philosophical argument as a back-and-forth dialogue or debate, generally between the character of Socrates, on one side, and some person or group of people to whom Socrates was talking (his interlocutors), on the other. In the course of the dialogues, Socrates’ interlocutors propose definitions of philosophical concepts or express views that Socrates challenges or opposes. The back-and-forth debate between opposing sides produces a kind of linear progression or evolution in philosophical views or positions: as the dialogues go along, Socrates’ interlocutors change or refine their views in response to Socrates’ challenges and come to adopt more sophisticated views. The back-and-forth dialectic between Socrates and his interlocutors thus becomes Plato’s way of arguing against the earlier, less sophisticated views or positions and for the more sophisticated ones later….

aswl1_e1,1915-1980,Roland,Barthes,Myth Today,"What is a myth, today? I shall give at the outset a first, very simple answer, which is perfectly consistent with etymology: myth is a type of speech.
 
Myth is a type of speech
 
Of course, it is not any type: language needs special conditions in order to become myth: we shall see them in a minute. But what must be firmly established at the start is that myth is a system of communication, that it is a message. This allows one to perceive that myth cannot possibly be an object, a concept, or an idea; it is a mode of signification, a form. Later, we shall have to assign to this form historical limits, conditions of use, and reintroduce society into it: we must nevertheless first describe it as a form….

aswl1_e1,,Robert,J. Zimmer,The Myth of the Successful College Dropout,"An increasingly familiar and seductive story has been circulating about young people who, drawing inspiration from billionaire entrepreneurs and computer giants, consider dropping out of college a fast track to business success.
 
Names like Jobs, Gates, Dell, and others lend star power to the myth of the wildly successful college dropout. One recent New York Times homage to the phenomenon compared dropping out to ""lighting out for the territories to strike gold,"" with one young executive describing it as ""almost a badge of honor"" among startup entrepreneurs. Like any myth, this story has a kernel of truth: There are exceptional individuals whose hard work, determination, and intelligence make up for the lack of a college degree. If they could do it, one might think, why can't everybody?

At universities around the world, students are claiming that reading books can unsettle them to the point of becoming depressed, traumatised or even suicidal. Some contend that Virginia Woolf’s novel Mrs Dalloway (1925), in which a suicide has taken place, could trigger suicidal thoughts among those disposed to self-harm. Others insist that F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby (1925), with its undercurrent of spousal violence, might trigger painful memories of domestic abuse. Even ancient classical texts, students have argued, can be dangerous: at Columbia University in New York, student activists demanded that a warning be attached to Ovid’s Metamorphoses on grounds that its ‘vivid depictions of rape’ might trigger a feeling of insecurity and vulnerability among some undergraduates….

 And all the reports on his conduct agree
 That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a

 For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.
 Except for the War till the day he retired
 He worked in a factory and never got fired,
 But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
 Yet he wasn’t a scab or odd in his views,
 For his Union reports that he paid his dues,
 (Our report on his Union shows it was sound)
 And our Social Psychology workers found
 That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.
 The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day
 And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.
 Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,
 And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.

 He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan
 And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,
 A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire…

 For a boy can't interpret the thing
 Till he is become a man.

 And wounded with arrowy smarts,

 Did she put on his knowledge with his power
 Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?

 But give them me, the mouth, the eyes, the brow!
 Let them once more absorb me! One look now
 Will lap me round for ever, not to pass
 Out of its light, though darkness lie beyond:
 Hold me but safe again within the bond
 Of one immortal look! All woe that was,
 Forgotten, and all terror that may be,
 Defied,—no past is mine, no future: look at me!

 Where the slow river
 meets the tide,
 a red swan lifts red wings
 and darker beak,
 and underneath the purple down
 of his soft breast
 uncurls his coral feet.
 
 Through the deep purple
 of the dying heat
 of sun and mist,
 the level ray of sun-beam
 has caressed
 the lily with dark breast,
 and flecked with richer gold
 its golden crest….

 The flowerlike
 animal perfume
 in the god’s curly
 hair —
 
 don’t assume
 that like a flower
 his attributes
 are there to tempt
 
 you or
 direct the moth’s
 hunger —
 simply he is
 the temple of himself,
 
 hair and hide
 a sacrifice of blood and flowers
 on his altar
 
 if any worshipper
 kneel or not.

 Think of our blindness where the water burned!
 Are we so certain that those wings, returned
 And turning, we had half discerned
 Before our dazzled eyes had surely seen
 The bird aloft there, did not mean?—
 Our hearts so seized upon the sign!
 
 Think how we sailed up-wind, the brine
 Tasting of daphne, the enormous wave
 Thundering in the water cave—
 Thunder in stone. And how we beached the skiff
 And climbed the coral of that iron cliff
 And found what only in our hearts we’d heard—
 The silver screaming of that one, white bird:
 The fabulous wings, the crimson beak
 That opened, red as blood, to shriek
 And clamor in that world of stone,
 No voice to answer but its own.
 
 What certainty, hidden in our hearts before,
 Found in the bird its metaphor?

 Zeus himself could not undo the web
 of stone closing around me.
 I have forgotten
 the men I was before; I follow the hated
 path of monotonous walls
 that is my destiny.
 Severe galleries
 which curve in secret circles
 to the end of the years.
 Parapets
 cracked by the days' usury.
 
 In the pale dust I have discerned
 signs that frighten me.
 In the concave
 evenings the air has carried a roar
 toward me, or the echo of a desolate howl.
 
 I know there is an Other in the shadows,
 whose fate it is to wear out the long solitudes
 which weave and unweave this Hades
 and to long for my blood and devour my death.
 
 Each of us seeks the other.
 If only this
 were the final day of waiting….
