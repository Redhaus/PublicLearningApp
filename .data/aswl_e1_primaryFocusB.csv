ASWL1_E1,850BCE-800BCE,Homer,,The Odyssey,"Composed around the 8th century BCE, Homer's Odyssey is a Greek epic and the sequel to Homer's other epic the Iliad. The Odyssey and the Iliad represent the oldest texts in the Western canon, making them both foundational to the study of Western literature. In ""Homer; Analysis and Influence"" (2008), Kostas Myrsiades notes that ""Homer's influence has pervaded all phases of contemporary culture"" (xi). Thought to be originally an oral narrative, this long poem tells of the homeward voyage of Odysseus following the Trojan War as well as his wife’s, Penelope’s, trials as she awaits his return, fearing him dead. Two primary themes in the text are the difficulty of long journeys and family loyalty. Other themes include revenge and the power of wit over physical strength. The Odyssey is also useful for teaching students the structure of the hero's journey. Although the text is quite long, it can be an exciting adventure for students. In ""Odysseus Deconstructed: Crossing the Threshold into Critical Thinking"", Emily Nicole Howell summarizes The Odyssey like this: ""[Odysseus,] the wily tactician dreams up the idea for the wooden horse trick, thereby winning the war for the Greeks. He visits hell and, against all odds, makes it back. He defeats the barbarous Cyclops, evades the seductive Sirens, and survives the terrifying Scylla and Charybdis. He has the unhealable wound, possesses a wondrous weapon, and even restores peace to his kingdom. There should be no question that he is indeed a hero; however, thousands of years later, in my ninth graders' eyes, the epic hero falls far, far short of what a hero should be—regardless of how well he fits the classical criteria"" ( 61).

ASWL1_E1,1930-1998,Ted,Hughes,Tales from Ovid,"One of his last published works and winner of the 1997 Whitbread Book of the Year, Ted Hughes’ reimagining of 24 tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses is an accessible and beautiful entrance to classical tales about the origins and relationships of the Greek gods.  For both an introduction to the beginner and a delight for the expert, Hughes retells the famous myths of Narcissus and Echo, Pygmalion, Midas, and more. These poems offer opportunities for the study of etiology, poetic devices, and dialectic relationships. As far as translations go, however, Hughes strays far from Ovid's original. Nevertheless, as John Taylor writes, ""For readers who have been put off by these mythological tales in more decorous translations yet who remain sensitive to Ovid's candid, less-virtuoso, plaints and yearnings . . . Hughes's renderings will delight"" (118). Peter Mcdonald agrees with Taylor's summation, writing that ""Hughes's strengths as a stylist have always been related to his ability to surprise. Simplicity and immediacy are of the essence, and, in his best poems, there is a powerful sense of the cutting away of the superfluous. In terms of rhythm, the language sounds in taut, sometimes slightly jittery and abrupt figures. Perhaps these are lyrical and dramatic strengths rather than narrative ones; at any rate, the best moments in Tales from Ovid are those at which Hughes can treat Ovid's narrative as a kind of pure action, where the style can be both high-speed and high- impact"" (67).

ASWL1_E1,43BCE-17/18CE,Ovid,,Metamorphoses,"Written around 8 CE, The Metamorphoses, or Book of Transformations, is one of the most influential texts in Western literature, inspiring such great authors as Dante, Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Shakespeare. Ovid offers over 250 mythical poems that tell the history of the world from its creation to the reign of Julius Caesar. A nearly-encyclopedic vision of Greek mythology, Ovid’s collection can be enjoyed as a whole or through individual selections. Ovid presents many of the most famous myths and legends of Greece and Rome, including, Pyramus and Thisbe, Perseus and Andromeda, Pygmalion, Daedalus and Icarus, and the fall of Troy. J. D. McClatchy provides this summary of Ovid's Metamorphoses: ""[T]he Metamorphoses was the last great poem of classical literature, a richly colored and intricately patterned tapestry of vignettes from mythology that have seemed over the centuries the stuff of both the school child's reader and a textbook on abnormal psychology. It has become the folklore of the unconscious—or, perhaps it would be better to say, the great mythographer Freud is our century's Ovid. But, unlike the good doctor, the poet was a wit, which implies a kind of double-knowing. Like Freud, Ovid relied on unreliable narrators and shifting perspectives, but he imbued his text with the quiet mockery of late pagan ism and the tenderness of early romanticism. It allows his readers both to experience and to judge the passions in his poem. Poets ever since have sought to take advantage of the charm or frisson his various tales evoke. But more to the point, Ovid goes to the heart of the poetic task. Change, things becoming other things, transformations . . . this is what poems do. Aristotle rightly claimed metaphor as the essence of poetry, and Ovid is the Mother Goose of metaphor, tak ing the trope and enlarging it into narratives as fantastic and logical as dreams"" (154).
