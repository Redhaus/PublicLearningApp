ASWL1_E1,"No Lords, No Masters: Create Your Own Pantheon","It is commonly understood that the essential qualities of a deity are omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. But is that what makes a god or goddess? Malevolent, magnificent, insignificant. Can an all-powerful being be anything? There are a lot of questions and so many answers. ","In this Performance, you will select from religions and cultures from around the world to create your own belief system.

ASWL1_E1,The Story of the Clod and the Pebble: Personification and Internal Monologue,"In many cases, the art of personification is closely linked to allegorical construction which is meaningful, sentient, and engaging. The attribution of human-like characteristics or actions to a non-human entity creates relateable messages without the stigma of a personal or social affront. ","In this Performance, you will utilize the techniques and perspectives of internal monologue of an inanimate object to create a relateable message or offer a social critique.","['A slam poem from the perspective of the inanimate object or entity,', 'A conversation between the right and left brain hemispheres within the mind of the inanimate object.', 'A metaphor map, in which students draw an image of a single metaphor they use to make sense of a concept, a text, or an event, and then–more importantly–they explicate their map in x paragraphs.', 'A dramatic monologue.', 'A cover-letter for a job or position written from the perspective of the chosen object.'] ","['slam poem','dialogue','metaphor map','dramatic monologue','cover letter']",,,,,
ASWL1_E1,The Color of Success: Model Minorities Myths and Social Realities,"Psychological research has shown that what society considers ancient myths are still with us. These tales have survived the test of time and are made manifest in the personal myths that people craft in our contemporary society. While some invent myths in order to achieve personal or professional goals or in order to attribute meaning to their lives, other people merely adhere to a pre-written script that seemingly dictates their futures. Which is the better route? To write your own rules or to follow those already written?","In this Performance, you will examine how individual identity functions in relation to social pressures, stereotypes, and myths.","['An epic poem, in the style of the Odyssey or Gilgamesh.', 'An origin myth narrative of x words.', 'A narration of your life from a social position or perspective outside of your own.', 'A series of x letters or x diary entries that shape your self-made myth and societys myth about you', 'A formal resume that narrates your self-made myth from a professional and academic perspective, as well as from your psychological or socio-emotional perspective.']",,,,,,
ASWL1_E1,What Would Isis Do?: Evaluating Your Personal Mythology,"Many people note mythic patterns and visionary motifs, which they feel may have shaped their pasts and will influence the course of their life. However, how many mythological incarnations can a person undergo? The goddess Isis transmuted from a humble and subservient wife into an all-powerful diety who protected the dead and guided seafarers. Appearing as a bird, scorpion, sow, or cow, she evaluated and transformed her mythic origins. Can we do the same today?","In this Performance, you will use the characteristics and techniques of myth in order to narrativize your own self-made myth.","['Create a hieroglyphic visual that depicts your transformation from birth to present.', 'A narration of differing experience in the same situation, as encountered through different incarnations.', 'A map of personal mythic trajectory onto a figure from Roman, Greek, or Mesopotamian myth.', 'A boardgame in which different figures, places, and rules dictate ones mythmaking in a dynamic setting.', 'A rewrite of the lyrics or lines of a particular song or poem, according to your mythic journey.', 'A formal Jungian analysis of your personal mythology.']",,,,,,
ASWL1_E1,"Theophany, Perdition, Wholism: Comparing Dualistic Entities",,,,,,,,,
ASWL1_E1,"Classify, Categorize, Compare: Creating the Binary","Attempt to speak about a person you know without the use of gendered descriptors. Do the adjectives you use shade your listener's perspective? Are the verbs you employ indicative of a particular gendered habitus? What about when you describe an object? The qualities of human and non-human entities are signified by the language used to describe them, but is a system of binary categorization a cultural construct or a universal phenomenon?","In this Performance, you will list, group, and label inanimate objects into distinct binary categories, comparing their features through a clearly identified cultural lens.","['a list of adjectives and adverbs divisable by gendered associations about the same object.', 'a linguistic comparison of masculine and feminine associations with objects in English and in a Romance language (noting variations and compiled with a written reflection comparing and contrasting the variations).', 'a cross-linguistic analysis of an object and its feminine or masculine associations across a minimum of x cultures with visual support.', 'an Object-Subject association of a personification of objects according to Jungian archetypes and gendered associations, and/or figures from Classical mythology.'] ",,,,,,
ASWL1_E1,Forever Jung: Juxtaposed Archetypes,"Carl Jung employed the concept of archetypes or ""original patterns"" in order to describe the human psyche and explain how people's unconcious motivations act as a catalyst for their actions. These constructs can be applied to literary myths and the psychology of the characters within them. Who seeks power? Who seeks knowledge? Who appears destined to liberate? Who was crafted to chase pleasure? Each text holds an answer, meant to be interpreted.","In this Performance, you will compare and contrast two characters as Jungian archetypes.","['a formal written comparison of two archetypal figures in a thesis, antithesis, synthesis essay.', 'a visual encyclopedia of two archetypes, their complexes, nuclear elements associated with those complexes, and individual and collective symbols.', 'a script and performance or a rewriting of archetypes from texts in a binary conversation or performance as if the two archetypes were to meet in some situation.', 'a transcript of an interview between Freud, Jung, and two archetypes.', 'a video project of a ""Day in the Life"" of x archetype(s), with a script and film lexicon component.']",,,,,,
ASWL1_E1,Tap the Thread: Text Comparisons in Twos,"As the Stoic Seneca explained in 65 CE, ""reading . . . many books is a distraction"" that leaves the reader ""disoriented and weak."" Oftentimes, a reader may read an iteration of a commonly known myth, only to find the content of that myth altered or repurposed in a contradictory manner by another author or text. This contrast, while disorienting, can be fruitful when closely examined by a scholar intent on uncovering strength, rather than devolving toward weakness, in their juxtaposition of two or more texts.","In this Performance, you will compare and contrast a textual element, literary feature, or technique of two texts.","['Compose a rewrite of a scene from two texts, interposing two symbols, literary techniques, or textual features with a reflection on the process.', 'Compose a formal written analysis of x words addressing the significance of symbols, themes, characterization, and motifs in relation to two texts.', 'Create a Text-to-Text T-Chart (Text A, FEATURE, Text B, Stakes/Importance).', 'Compose an analysis of each feature, element, or technique within the context of its text using semantic mapping to visually display the meaning-based connections between a word or phrase and a set of related words or concepts with an x word summary of findings.', 'Create dust-jackets for two texts with visual and written components highlighting a major symbol, technique, and element or feature of the two texts.']",,,,,,
ASWL1_E1,Cradle-to-cradle: Understanding the Non-linear Self,"Each society holds its own myths and cultural images. However, not all societies share a linear understanding of time or trajectory. Many cultures understand the concepts of origin and futurity as cyclical, seamless, or iterative. How can one understand one's own trajectory in a cyclical, iterative, or rhizomatic way?","In this Performance, you will construct and present yourself as a mythic hero, by employing a non-linear framework.","['Create a map of personal identity according to the categories (assemblage, affect, rhizome, qualitative multiplicity, abstract machine, encounter, difference and repetition, virtual/actual, nomad, centre/margins (Braidotti), posthuman performativity (Barad).', 'Create a non-linear graphic novel with component parts or a manga, with component parts.', 'Create a visual performance of the self as a non-linear series of vignettes, utilizing two or more Jungian archetypes.', 'Compose an x word narration of a personal myth as virtual and actual.', 'Create a Mayan calendar of personal myth to-date using a two count circle framework.']",,,,,,
